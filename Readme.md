## Scientific Calculator
    A scientific calculator is a type of electronic calculator, usually but not always
handheld, designed to calculate problems in science, engineering and mathematics.
They have completely replaced slide rules in traditional applications, and are widely
used in both education and professional settings so I simulate scientific calculator in
Windows form application with C# as a programming language with some advanced
additional feature and some are on the way

### Features:
 Some features that i implemented in my scientific calculator are listed below:
         * Easy to use with good looking user interface
         * Can solve any type of trigonometric and logarithmic expressions
         * Animated window
         * Can be used with inbuilt button as well as input from keyboard
         * Temperature convertor and many more advanced features are on the way
         * Better user experience
