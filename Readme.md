## Scientific Calculator:
A scientific calculator is a type of electronic calculator, usually but not always
handheld, designed to calculate problems in science, engineering and mathematics.
They have completely replaced slide rules in traditional applications, and are widely
used in both education and professional settings so I simulate scientific calculator in
Windows form application with C# as a programming language with some advanced
additional feature and some are on the way

### Features:
